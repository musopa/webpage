  <h3 class="center">Cleaning up unwanted start&#45;up programs</h3>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>Many freeware and commercial software programs have a habit of setting themselves up to run automatically upon Windows start&#45;up&#46; This can contribute to the gradual decline in start&#45;up speed that most Windows 7 systems &#40;and
      Windows PCs in general&#41; experience&#46; Also&#44; having programs that you only use selectively&#44; or not at all&#44; load automatically is a waste of system resources that could be better used for other things&#46; To top it off&#44;
      many
      internets nasties such as spyware programs&#44; viruses and Trojan horses will install themselves into one of the automatic start locations on your system in order to make sure that they are run on start&#45;up&#46; So the point is take a look
      at
      what is currently running every time you load you&#39;re PC&#44; and disable what you don&#39;t need or can&#39;t identify&#46;</p>

      <li>Uncheck all unwanted programs and click Apply and then click Close</li>
      <li>You will be prompted to restart your PC</li>

  <h3 class="center">Flushing DNS</h3>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>It is really important to do some maintenance on the regular basis if you want get lot out of surfing the web&#46; Depending on how much time you spend on surfing it is a good idea to clean your DNS cache once in a while&#46; I suggest doing
      this every month if you are using internet more than two hours a day&#46; When you visit a website&#44; Windows tries to speed things up by placing the DNS information about that site&#44; into a DNS cache on your PC&#46; This is OK until there
      are problems with outside networks &#40;WAN&#41;&#44; DNS servers or even the website&#33; </p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>DNS Windows cache stores BOTH negative and positive entries&#46; The positive entries are those that the DNS query was correct and you could connect to the website&#46; Negative entries are those where the DNS query failed and you could not
      connect to the website&#46;</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>A problem can arise here because if the DNS cache holds a negative entry and the website you want to view is now OK to view&#44; Windows will still give you a DNS error&#33;</p>
  </div>

  <p class="link"><a title="Domain Name System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">DNS error</a></p>


  <p class="center">To flush those DNS entries</p>

  <div class="lists">
    <ul>
      <li>Click on Start and go to Run</li>
      <li>In the box type in cmd (the command prompt black square window will pop up)</li>
      <li>on the blinking cursor type <span class="bold">ipconfig &#47; flushdns</span> and hit Enter</li>
      <li>The Next thing we' re going to do is get rid of your temporary internet files and cookies</li>
      <li>Go to control panel and select Performance Information and Tools select Open Disc Cleanup</li>
      <li>Select the options to remove and Delete the Files</li>
