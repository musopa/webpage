    <p>I've been thinking of my lovely wife today and how much I miss her since her death hope I get to be with her again someday I found these words I'd written for her when I first met her I was certainly a smooth talking dude in my youth so here
      they are</p>
    <p>I know that I fell in love with you the first moment that I saw you, if you could have seen my emotions in the form of a cartoon, my eyes would have popped out on springs and flopped about, knocked-out by your beauty. My heart would be
      pounding and bursting to leave my body wanting to thrust out from my chest and with the customary throbbing and glowing red heart shape on show flickering like a neon sign, with the noise of my heartbeat echoing and overpowering all the other
      sounds of life going on around us at the time, and that steam kettle feeling that starts in your toes and gradually progresses up through your body like a thermometer gauge, exploding in your head and erupting out like a steam whistle, spurting
      out of the top of your head with the words I'm in love darting and flying around the room and hitting the walls and rebounding in all directions, leaving you like a punch-drunk boxer who doesn't know what's hit him, what day or year it is or
      even what planet he's on, but simply wishing to be shipwrecked between your thighs.</p>
    <p> But above all else I wanted to put down in words my feelings towards you, a woman I have become besotted with, you are a beautiful person who I want to marry and be my wife, best friend and lover, I felt this way right from the first moment
      that I saw you. So all I can really say to you is that I love you I always will and that I want to be with you for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>All my Love Phil.</p>
