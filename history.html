    <p>SGML or Standard Generalised Markup Language was created by IBM and became the standard recognised by the computer industry&#46; HTML or Hypertext Markup Language designed by Tim&nbsp;Berners&#45;Lee whilst working for &#40;CERN&#41; the
      European organisation for nuclear research and used for distributing documents over networks is similar to SGML and has become the standard used in web documents&#44; HTML has been extended and modified over the years&#44; the base set of HTML
      tags&#44; is referred to as HTML 2&#46; 0</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>HTML 2&#46; 0 published in November 1995 is the old standard&#44; it is a written specification that was maintained by the W3C www&#46;w3c&#46;org&#44; it&#39;s a set of tags that all browsers support&#46;</p>

    <p>Below is a quote by Tim Berners&#45;Lee creator of HTML&#46;</p>
    <p><em>&quot;The Google algorithm was a significant development&#46; I&#39;ve had thank&#45;you emails from people whose lives have been saved by information on a medical website or who have found the love of their life on a dating
        website&#46;&quot;</em>

    <p>The HTML 3&#46;2 specification was developed in early 1996 and was released in January 1997 and several software vendors including IBM&#44; Microsoft&#44; Netscape&#44; Novell&#44; and Sun Microsystems&#44; joined with the W3C to develop this
      specification&#46; Some of the primary additions to HTML 3&#46;2 included features such as tables&#44; applets&#44; and text flow around images&#46; HTML 3&#46;2 also provided full backward&#45;compatibility with the existing HTML 2&#46;0
      standard&#46;</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>HTML 4&#46;0&#44; first introduced in December 1997&#44; incorporates many new features that give you greater control than HTML 2&#46;0 and 3&#46;2 in how you design your pages&#46; Like HTML 2&#46;0 and 3&#46;2&#44; the W3C maintains the HTML
      4&#46;0 standard&#46; Framesets &#40;originally introduced in Netscape 2&#46;0&#41; and floating frames &#40;originally introduced in Internet Explorer 3&#46;0&#41; have become an official part of the HTML 4&#46;0 specification&#44; additional
      improvements were made to table formatting and rendering&#46; By far&#44; however&#44; the most important change in HTML 4&#46;0 was its increased integration with style sheets&#46;</p>

  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>In December 1999 HTML 4&#46;01 was published as a W3C recommendation&#44; there are three types of HTML 4&#46;01 DTD document types&#44; Transitional&#44; Strict and Frameset&#46; The most important thing you can do if your new to HTML is to
      start writing valid HTML 4&#46;01&#44; also start writing your tags in lower case&#44; always close your tag elements and never end a paragraph without the &lt;/p&gt; tag&#46; XHTML 1&#46;0 was developed in 2001&#44; and XHTML 2&#46;0 in
      2004&#44; XHTML describes the content and structure of a Web page&#44; XHTML is HTML and XML combined it contains all the features of HTML&#44; but uses XML&#39;s syntax&#44; XML &#40;Extensible Mark&#45;up Language&#41; is a language used for
      creating other languages&#44; with XML you can define your own tags&#46; </p>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>In January 2008 HTML5 was published as a working draft by the W3C&#46; Another group decided to evolve HTML independently of the W3C and formed the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (or WHATWG) in 2004. Currently the W3C works
      on publishing a stable version of the specification, while the WHATWG continues to work on what they call a “living standard” of the specification.</p>
