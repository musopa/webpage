  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>JavaScript and ECMA script&#44; is the scripting language known for web application and access to objects in other programs&#44; JavaScript was inspired by the SELF programming language but its roots are from the ECMA&#45;262 script&#44;
      Netscape&#39;s implementation of ECMA&#45;262 script was originally developed by Brendan Eich &#40;Mozilla&#39;s Chief Technology Officer&#41; originally called Mocha and then Live script and then changed to JavaScript around the same time as
      Netscape navigator added support for JavaScript in 1995&#46;</p>
    <p>ECMA is the standardised version of JavaScript which is loosely based on the C programming language&#44; JavaScript is a trademark of Sun micro&#45;systems&#46;</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>JavaScript is used to enhance and energise the user&#39;s web browser experience and can work in tandem with other technologies such as HTML &#40;Hypertext mark&#45;up language&#41;&#44; CSS &#40;Cascading style sheets&#41; it narrows the gap
      for web traffic responding to user input and interaction&#44; dynamically modifying the web browser content&#44; it can pre&#45;process data on the client side before sending the data to the server&#46;</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>Managing the navigation of multiple frames and you can write functions into HTML pages that interact with the DOM &#40;Document Object Model&#41; www&#46;w3&#46;org&#47;DOM this describes HTML or XML documents in a object&#45;orientation
      fashion allowing an API &#40;Application Program Interface&#41; for accessing and changing content&#44; style and document structure to work with JavaScript enabled browsers like Microsoft&#39;s Internet Explorer&#44; Opera&#44; Mozilla Firefox
      etc&#46;</p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>JavaScript is not Java it&#39;s not an easier way to build Java applets both are loosely based on the C programming language but are way more different than similar they use totally different interpreters to execute code Java has an extensive
      language vocabulary its object oriented programming&#44; JavaScript has a small vocabulary making it a much simpler and easier programming model&#44; JavaScript is used for client sided scripting and is meant for much different applications
      then Java&#46;</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>Some related scripting languages are Microsoft&#39;s VB script &#40;Visual basic for Internet Explorer&#41; also used for client sided web page scripting&#44; Jscript is Microsoft compatible JavaScript for Internet Explorer&#44; Action Script
      for Macromedia flash is similar&#44; JavaScript OSA &#40;JSOSA&#41; for Macintosh Mac OSx which is similar to Microsoft&#39;s Jscript&#46;net but offering more object orientation features&#44; Adobe&#39;s Photoshop and Adobe&#39;s creative suit
      uses JavaScript&#46;</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>A novice programmer can enhance web pages with a text editor and browser&#44; JavaScript lets you create interactive interfaces&#44; run simple data queries&#44; validate forms&#44; make data interactive&#44; work with multiple frames&#44;
      generate server&#45;less CGI &#40;Common Gateway Interfaces&#41;&#44; offload busy servers&#44; JavaScript cannot read or write files on client machines&#44; except browser cookies&#59; and you can&#39;t read or write on servers either&#44; you
      can&#39;t close windows it didn't open or read information from other opened web pages from another server&#46;</p>
