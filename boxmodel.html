    <p>Margins are transparent space that goes around a given element&#44; in the box model they are outside of the border of an element and can be used to help separate adjoining boxes on a web page&#44; the border goes around the padding and
      content
      area&#44; the padding clears an area around the content&#44; and the content area is where the text and images appear&#44; you should know that when you specify the width and height of an element&#44; you are just setting the width and height
      of
      the content area&#44; to know the full size of the element&#44; you must also add the padding&#44; border and margin to the size of the box&#46;</p>

    <p>The Internet Explorer box model bug refers to the way in which earlier versions of Internet Explorer handle the sizing of elements in a web page&#44; which differs from the standard way recommended by the W3C for the Cascading Style Sheets
      language&#46; As of Internet Explorer 6&#44; the browser supports an alternative rendering mode &#40;called the &#34;standards&#45;compliant mode&#34;&#41; which solves this discrepancy&#46; However&#44; for backward compatibility reasons&#44;
      all versions still behave in the usual&#44; non-standard way by default &#40;see quirks mode&#41;&#46; Internet Explorer for Mac is not affected by this non-standard behavior&#46;</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>In computing&#44; quirks mode refers to a technique used by some web browsers for the sake of maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for older browsers&#44; instead of strictly complying with W3C and IETF standards in
      standards mode&#46;</p>

    <p>A web browser is a software application for retrieving&#44; presenting&#44; and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web&#46; An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier &#40;URI&#41; and may be a web
      page&#44; image&#44; video&#44; or other piece of content&#46; Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources&#46; A web browser can also be defined as an application software or program
      designed to enable users to access&#44; retrieve and view documents and other resources on the Internet&#46;</p>

    <p>Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web&#44; they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems&#46; The major web browsers are Firefox&#44; Google
