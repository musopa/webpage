  <p>Cascading Style Sheets &#40;CSS&#41; is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics &#40;the look and formatting&#41; of a document written in a markup language&#46; Its most common application is to style web pages
    written in HTML and XHTML&#44; but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document&#44; including plain XML&#44; SVG and XUL&#46;</p>

  <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content &#40;written in HTML or a similar markup language&#41; from document presentation&#44; including elements such as the layout&#44; colors&#44; and fonts&#46; This separation
    can improve content accessibility&#44; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics&#44; enable multiple pages to share formatting&#44; and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content
    &#40;such as by allowing for tableless web design&#41;. CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods&#44; such as on&#45;screen&#44; in print&#44; by voice &#40;when read out by a
    speech&#45;based browser or screen reader&#41; and on Braille-based&#44; tactile devices&#46; It can also be used to allow the web page to display differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed&#46; While the
    author of a document typically links that document to a CSS style sheet&#44; readers can use a different style sheet&#44; perhaps one on their own computer&#44; to override the one the author has specified&#46;</p>

  <p>CSS specifies a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element&#46; In this so&#45;called cascade&#44; priorities or weights are calculated and assigned to rules&#44; so that the
    results are predictable&#46; </p>
