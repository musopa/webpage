  <p>JavaScript was originally developed in Netscape&#44; by Brendan Eich&#46; Battling with Microsoft over the Internet&#44; Netscape considered their client&#45;server solution as a distributed OS&#44; running a portable version of Sun Microsystem&#39;s Java&#46; Because Java was a competitor of C&#43;&#43; and aimed at professional programmers&#44; Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers&#44; like Microsoft&#39;s VB&#46;</p>

  <p>Developed under the name Mocha&#44; LiveScript was the official name for the language when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2&#46;0 in September 1995&#44; but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2&#46;0B3&#46;</p>

  <p>JavaScript &#40;sometimes abbreviated JS&#41; is a prototype&#45;based scripting language that is dynamic&#44; weakly typed and has first&#45;class functions&#46; It is a multi&#45;paradigm language&#44; supporting object&#45;oriented&#44; imperative&#44; and functional programming styles&#46;</p>

  <p>JavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily used in the form of client&#45;side JavaScript&#44; implemented as part of a Web browser in order to give enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites&#46; This enables programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment&#46;</p>

  <p>JavaScript's use in applications outside Web pages &#45; for example in PDF documents&#44; site&#45;specific browsers&#44; and desktop widgets &#45; is also significant&#46; Newer and faster JavaScript VMs and frameworks built upon them &#40;notably Node&#46;js&#41; have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server&#45;side web applications&#46;</p>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>JavaScript uses syntax influenced by that of C&#46; JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java&#44; but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics&#46; The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme programming languages&#46; For more visit </p>
